      "may satisfy the definition of factory ; but it seems to \n",
      "us that such an adjunct of an establishment is prima \n",

      "Bombay, claiming payment of overtime wages under the Payment \n",
      "of Wages Act, 1936 (4 of 1936). It is true that the definition of \"establish-\n",

      "plain that factory is treated by the Act as separate and \n",
      "distinct and there can be no doubt that the provisions \n",
      "in the Act which apply to establishment are not \n",
      "intended to, and do not, apply to factories. The Allthority \n",
